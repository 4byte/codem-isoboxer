## Description

`codem-isoboxer` is a small browser-based MPEG-4 (ISOBMFF) parser. It is meant to be small, fast and efficient. A typical use-case would be inclusion in a new player framework (for emerging standards such as MPEG-DASH which rely on ISOBMFF for most situations) or to extract metadata from MPEG-4 files:

* Parsing `emsg` boxes for in-band events;
* Parsing `mdat` boxes for extracting subtitles;
* Validating ISOBMFF segments before playing them back;
* [etc.]

Currently a limited set of ISOBMFF boxes is supported:

### ISO/IEC 14496-12:2012 (ISOBMFF)
* free / skip
* ftyp / styp
* mdat
* mdia
* mdhd
* moov / moof
* mvhd / mfhd
* sidx
* tfhd / tkhd
* tfdt
* traf / trak
* trun

### ISO/IEC 23009-1:2014 (MPEG-DASH)

* emsg

Support for more boxes can easily be added by adding additional box parsers in `src/iso_box.js`. Some utility functions are included to help with reading the various ISOBMFF data types from the raw file.

## Requirements

A modern web browser with support for:

* ArrayBuffer
* DataView

## Usage

Include one of the files in the `dist` folder (regular or minified) in your web page/application:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="iso_boxer.min.js"></script>

Then, you can parse a file by calling the `parseBuffer` function:

    var parsedFile = ISOBoxer.parseBuffer(arrayBuffer);

The `arrayBuffer` can be obtained for example by issuing an `XMLHttpRequest` with `responsetype` set to `arrayBuffer`, or by using
the `FileReader` API to read a local file.

`codem-isoboxer` makes no assumptions on the validity of the given file and/or segment. It also does minimal handling of the data
types and provides mostly a raw interface. Some frequently used attributes are parsed to easier-to-use types, such as the major
brand and list of compatible brands in the `ftyp` box.

Another way to use the software is to only retrieve the boxes you are interested in. This way you don't have to traverse the box
structure yourself:

    var parsedFile = ISOBoxer.parseBuffer(arrayBuffer); // Parse the file
    var ftyp       = parsedFile.fetch('ftyp');          // Fetch the first box with the specified type (`ftyp`)
    var mdats      = parsedFile.fetchAll('mdat');       // Fetch all the boxes with the specified type (`mdat`)

Traversal of the box structure is always depth first.

An additional utility method is included to convert DataViews into strings (completely na√Øve, no fancy encoding support):

    var parsedFile = ISOBoxer.parseBuffer(arrayBuffer); // Parse the file
    var mdat       = parsedFile.fetch('mdat');          // Get the first 'mdat' box
    var text       = ISOBoxer.Utils.dataViewToString(mdat.data); // Convert the data into a string (e.g. captions)

For traversing the box structure you can use the `_parent` property. It contains exactly what you expect: the parent of the
current box. The opposite is the `boxes` property (only available on container boxes such as `moov`), which gives you its children.

### NodeJS

Does it work in NodeJS? Well, it's really meant to be run in a web browser, but since Node supports most features it shouldn't be
a problem. You can install it using NPM:

    npm install codem-isoboxer

Then use it in your code (NodeJS v0.10.36 tested, 0.12.x should work as well):

    var ISOBoxer    = require('codem-isoboxer'),
        fs          = require('fs');
    var arrayBuffer = new Uint8Array(fs.readFileSync('my_test_file.mp4')).buffer;
    var parsedFile  = ISOBoxer.parseBuffer(arrayBuffer);

Et voila. It does not support any of the fancy stream stuff from Node. Also, the Node console has some issues with printing objects
that contain buffers/dataviews/circular references. It might not look pretty in the console, but it works.

## Development

Check out the source from Github. Make changes to the files in `/src`. We use `grunt` to build the distribution files. If you add a box parser be sure to include a comment that points toward the relevant section in the specs. And if at all possible add a (small!) file to `test/fixtures` to provide an example.
The test directory is not included in the published package on npmjs.org because of the included MPEG-4 files.

### Building

    grunt

### Using grunt watcher

You can use `grunt-contrib-watch` to watch for changes to the source and automatically build it:

    grunt watch

## Demo

Open `test/index.html` in your browser. Use the file picker to select a local MPEG-4 file to parse it. Results will be in the `window.parsedFile` variable. Inspect it from your browser's console. Some test files are included in `test/fixtures` (not included in the package published on npmjs.org).
